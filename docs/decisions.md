# Design decisions

Why ha-chauffage works the way it does. Each decision says what was chosen and why; the tests
prove the behavior ([use-cases.md](use-cases.md)), the [changelog](../CHANGELOG.md) says when it
changed. Vocabulary: [glossary.md](glossary.md). Add a decision here when you make one that a
future contributor might question.

## Integration

- **An integration, not a YAML package** (v0.2). The v0.1 package (template sensors holding the
  data, automations, events from the card) hit its limits: attribute size, no real services, no
  configuration UI, no HACS, YAML to edit by hand. Its data is still imported when the
  integration is added (`importer.py`).
- **Domain `chauffage`, a single config entry.** One installation per Home Assistant; entity
  ids do not depend on the language (`select.chauffage_schedule`), their names are translated.
- **Data in a versioned `Store`** (`.storage/chauffage`), migrated automatically, each migration
  tested with a fixture of the former format. Going back to an older version is not supported.
- **A first setup waits for Home Assistant to be running** (retried automatically): during
  startup, the package's restored states and automations may not exist yet.
- **Settings in the card, not in the options flow.** HA's option forms (generated fields, no
  layout, no preview) proved impractical for setting temperatures room by room. The options
  keep a single form of defaults (override duration, use of the thermostats' own presets).

## Scheduling

- **A tick every minute** applies the slots starting now and the overrides ending now; every
  thermostat is realigned when HA starts, a schedule is activated or the weeks are saved. A
  slot that started during a missed minute (HA busy, summer time) is applied late, not never.
- **The integration recognizes its own changes by their context**, not only by "not made by an
  automation": a thermostat's answer to the scheduler can never become an override.
- **A manual change is judged against what the schedule expects**: on a thermostat driven by
  temperature, any other setpoint is an override; the thermostat reaching the expected
  temperature is not.
- **Thermostats turned off, unavailable or overridden are left alone**; one coming back is
  realigned at once. A command that was not delivered is sent again every minute. Commands are
  spaced out (Zigbee networks).
- **No special case for Versatile Thermostat's safety mode**: VTherm keeps the requested preset
  and returns to it by itself, so the usual rules are right (v0.2.0-beta.3 removed a special
  case that overwrote a user's choice).

## Presets

- **Presets of the integration, not of a thermostat** (v0.3). Slots ask for *Comfort*, *Eco*…;
  for each thermostat, a preset is its own climate preset with the same name when it has one
  (and the option allows it), otherwise the preset's temperature, fitted to the thermostat's
  limits and step. It can be set by hand per thermostat. Versatile Thermostat becomes one case
  among others.
- **No *Off* preset** (yet): thermostats turned off, by hand or for the summer, are left alone.
- **A preset used in the weeks cannot simply be removed**: another one takes its place.
- **Temperatures of the thermostats' own presets** are learned while each preset is active (no
  standard attribute gives them); Versatile Thermostat's are read from its attributes, a
  deliberate extra for its users.

## Schedules

- **Schedules are defined by the user** (v0.4), not predefined modes: their meaning (a day out,
  holidays, remote work…) is only their content; when one is active and until when is the job of
  the select entity, automations, and later a calendar of schedules.
- **A new installation has a single schedule**, *Normal*; others are created empty (eco, or the
  first preset, all week) or as a copy.
- **Stable ids**, as everywhere in HA: given from the name when a schedule is created, never
  changed; automations use them (`chauffage.activate_schedule`, attribute `schedule_id`). The
  select's options stay the names, for dashboards.
- **The active schedule and the last one cannot be deleted**; unsaved edits of the weeks are
  saved before a schedule is created, renamed, moved or deleted.

## Card

- **No build step**: one JavaScript file, served by the integration and loaded on every page
  (card and more-info block). Bundling comes with the translations as files (roadmap).
- **Loaded with `add_extra_js_url`, registered twice if needed**, not as a Lovelace resource
  (nothing to configure, and the more-info block needs it on every page). The module is loaded
  in parallel with HA's frontend, which replaces `customElements` with a scoped registry
  polyfill: a card evaluated first (cached) would be unknown to it. The card defines its
  elements again once `<home-assistant>` is defined, in the registry in place then (#2).
- **Saves carry the revision they edited**: a save from an outdated copy is refused instead of
  overwriting someone else's changes.
- **The card's type stays `custom:chauffage-programme-card`**: dashboards refer to it.
- **The card is newer than the integration right after an update** (HACS replaces the files,
  HA is not restarted yet): it asks for a restart instead of breaking.
- **The history of the measured temperature is read from HA's recorder**, not stored by the
  integration: nothing to keep or migrate, and it works for any thermostat with a
  `current_temperature`. Hence the last 7 days (within the recorder's default 10-day retention),
  each weekday showing its last occurrence; one scale per thermostat for its 7 days (comparable
  days), set by the measured temperature and the setpoints within 3° of it: a setpoint further
  away (frost protection at night) would flatten the curve, so it stays on the edge of the bar.
  The measured temperature is a smooth 1.5 px white line, without outline or shadow (an outline
  left grey inside the curve): straight lines between the values, held flat until 15 minutes
  before a change (the integration only sends changes: a straight line would invent a slope over
  hours, steps looked aliased). The setpoint applied is a 1 px bright yellow line with a drop
  shadow, drawn over it and the slots' handles (a dashed line was lost under the handles and where
  the curves cross; yellow without shadow vanished on the orange of *Comfort*; a dark line was not
  liked). No derived value (heating delay, rate) is shown: the user judges, heating anticipation
  is on the roadmap.
- **The integration reads that history for the card (`chauffage/history`)** instead of the card
  calling HA's `history/history_during_period`: for a `climate` entity, HA sends every attribute
  of every change (`climate` is a "significant" domain, so neither `significant_changes_only` nor
  `minimal_response` reduce it, and attributes cannot be picked), 6.7 MB for a week of the
  development HA's five thermostats, seconds on a small server or a remote connection. The
  integration keeps only the measured and target temperatures, when one of them changes (200 kB),
  and keeps what it read in memory: a later call only reads the last minutes. Not the
  temperature sensors' statistics (tiny): a thermostat does not say which sensor it uses, some
  have none, and the setpoint is only in the thermostat's attributes. The card falls back to HA's
  history while HA has not been restarted after an update.

## Process

- **Tests first, and the tests are the documentation** (CONTRIBUTING.md, "Tests first"); every
  behavior test runs on the three kinds of thermostats.
- **A change to the stored data or the installation goes through a beta** installed on a real
  installation before the release.
- **One vocabulary** ([glossary.md](glossary.md)), in the UI, the docs, the code and the data.
- **Version 1.0** once ha-chauffage works with groups of thermostats and any thermostat.
